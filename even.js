const isEven  = function (num) {
  return num % 2 === 0;
}
//isEven takes a number as its parameter and comes back with a Boolean value as to whether the number is even.

//const tenIsEven = isEven(10);
//const elevenIsEven = isEven(11);

//console.log(tenIsEven);
//console.log(elevenIsEven);

//The above code can be further simplified by nesting it into the console.log

console.log(isEven(10));
console.log(isEven(11));
